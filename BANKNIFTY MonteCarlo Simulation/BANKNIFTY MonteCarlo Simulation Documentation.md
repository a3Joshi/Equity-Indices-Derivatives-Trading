# Monte Carlo Simulation for BANKNIFTY: Documentation
## Introduction
The Monte Carlo simulation is a statistical technique that uses random sampling to model and analyze the behavior of complex systems. In finance, it is used to project the future prices of assets by generating a large number of possible scenarios based on historical data and random processes. This documentation outlines the process of performing a Monte Carlo simulation to forecast the future prices of the BANKNIFTY index.

## Key Concepts
Random Sampling: Generating random samples from a known distribution to simulate various outcomes.
Multiple Iterations: Repeating the process many times to create a distribution of possible outcomes.
Stochastic Processes: Using models that incorporate randomness to predict future values.
Steps in the Monte Carlo Simulation
Load Historical Data:

Historical price data for BANKNIFTY is obtained, typically covering several years to ensure a comprehensive dataset.
This data provides the basis for calculating historical returns and estimating future price movements.
Calculate Daily Returns:

Daily returns are computed from the historical closing prices of BANKNIFTY.
The daily return is the percentage change in price from one day to the next.
This step helps to understand the asset's historical volatility and average return.
Simulation Parameters:

Define the number of simulations (e.g., 1000) and the number of future days (e.g., 252, representing one trading year).
The last available price is used as the starting point for the simulations.
Random Sampling and Future Price Paths:

Use historical daily returns to estimate the mean (average return) and standard deviation (volatility).
Generate future price paths using a stochastic process, specifically the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model:
Drift: The expected return adjusted for volatility.
Shock: The random component of the return, modeled using a normal distribution scaled by historical volatility.
Prices are projected forward by applying the drift and shock to the current price iteratively over the specified number of days.
Geometric Brownian Motion Model:

A common model used in financial simulations to predict future prices.
It assumes that prices follow a log-normal distribution, which means they can vary over time in a multiplicative manner.
The model incorporates both a deterministic trend (drift) and a random component (shock), reflecting real-world market behavior.
Statistical Analysis and Visualization:

After generating multiple simulated price paths, statistical measures (mean, minimum, maximum) are calculated for each day.
These statistics provide insights into the range and distribution of possible future prices.
Visualize the results by plotting all simulated paths and overlaying the mean, minimum, and maximum price paths.
Practical Use
Risk Assessment: By visualizing the range of potential outcomes, investors can assess the risk associated with the asset.
Investment Decisions: The simulation helps in making informed investment decisions by projecting a range of possible future prices.
Scenario Analysis: Investors can test different scenarios and strategies under varying market conditions.
Conclusion
The Monte Carlo simulation is a powerful tool for forecasting future prices and understanding the potential risks and returns of financial assets. By incorporating historical data and stochastic modeling, it provides a comprehensive view of the possible future trajectories of an asset like BANKNIFTY. This technique aids investors in making well-informed decisions by visualizing a range of outcomes based on historical volatility and returns.
